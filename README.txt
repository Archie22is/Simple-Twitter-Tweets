Really simple Twitter Tweets - Tweets Display plugin for your site using new OAuth api v1.1

== Description ==

A really simple twitter tweets display widget.

**Why?**

Because Twitter changed their API again. Removing version 1.0 of the API altogether and by forcing version 1.1 of the API and use of the OAuth authentication requirement.

This means Twitter users who want to display their Tweets on their website (or within an application) have to create a Twitter Application to get access to the required Keys and Tokens Twitter provides for Authentication.

The process is pretty simple really, so just follow the installation and you'll be setup in a jiffy.

== Installation ==

Installation as simple as 1,2,3 or maybe 4 because of Twitter :)

1. Upload `simple-twitter-tweets` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add the Widget to your page (e.g. Sidebar) and update the required details
4. Note: You will need to create a Twitter Application - See below

= Creating a Twitter Application =

The Twitter Widget will never ask for your password, as it gets all your required data from the Open Authentication keys and phrases you will get by creating your application at Twitter. It also means that if you change your password, you wonâ€™t need to update any of the details of your Widget.

To find these details, go to https://dev.twitter.com/ and sign in.

Once you have logged in successfully, hover over your name in the top right corner, and click "My Applications," then "Create a New Application."

Enter a unique name (anything you want), a description (again this is just for you), and your site's URL. You can leave the Callback URL empty as it is not used for this implementation.

Yay, success - OK! You will be taken to a new screen, there's one more step then you can copy all the details into correct fields of the Widget and be on your way.

OK, click the "Create my Access Token" button. This is a shortcut to authenticate your own account with your application (so you never need use your password).

Good. Now click the Details Tab as all the information you need is presented hereso you can just copy the required information into the exact corresponding inputs fields of the Widget.

= The Widget Options =

* You can select the Title of the Widget as you like.
